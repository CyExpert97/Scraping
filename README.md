# AiCore Project (League of legends decision making)
This is my repository for my AiCore project based on the game League of Legends. The purpose of the project is to help create a model that helps you make better decisions in game. 

Currentelly I have webscraped data for league of legends which includes:

1. Getting url links for probuild webpages
2. Gather champion winrates and pickrates
3. Gathering information on individual champion ingame stats
